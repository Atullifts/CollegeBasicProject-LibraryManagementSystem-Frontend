        <h2> Know About Books Motion</h2>
        <p claas="para">Books Motion is an online service to help people catalog their books easily. You can access your catalog from anywhere—even on your mobile phone. Because everyone catalogs together, Books Motion also connects people with the same books, comes up with suggestions for what to read next, and so forth.</p>


        <h2>What software does it require?</h2>
        <p>
            None. If you can read this, you can use Books Motion.
        </p>

        <h2>What does it cost?</h2>
        <p>
            Zip, zilch, nada! Books Motion couldn't be happier to go free to all in March 2022 (blog post here). Whether you're an individual or an organization, you can catalog any number of books for free. See here for more info about organizational accounts.
        </p>

        <h2>What information do I need to give up?</h2>
        <p>
            None. Setting up an account requires only a user name and a password. We do strongly encourage you to include your email address when you sign up—this is very helpful in case you ever forget your password. You can also edit your profile to make yours a "private" account. With a private account, nobody else can see what books you have.
